# Startup-success
Welcome to my first repository!
-----------------------------------
So "Main.py" is the main code. Right now, you need a python interpreter to actually use this. But hopefully in the future,
front end developers will help us out and add graphics and a nice UI for this. So, looking for front end devs.

For the time being, you need to save Main.py locally and execute it through a python interpreter.
-----------------------------------
Looking for developers fluent in JS to create a GUI. We can integrate it withh python (the back-end language) using Flask.
