# Startup-success
Welcome to my first repository!
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
So "Main.py" is the main code. Right now, you need a python interpreter to actually use this. But hopefully in the future,
 front end developers will help us out and add graphics and a nice UI for this. So, looking for front end developers.

For the time being, you need to save Main.py locally and execute it through a python interpreter. Looking for developers 
fluent in python. I am using a library called "pysimplegui" to make the GUI.

Python is the language that will be used for back end as well as front end programming.

Also if you have downloaded the zip file from SSP's repository, you will see a folder called "WebPages", and under this, 
click "Home". You will find information about SSP and also links to other pages to help you out.

NOTE: Since this is the pre-alpha version and has no GUI for specific OS, you can use this on any OS that has a python interpreter.
