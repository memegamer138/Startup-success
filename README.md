# Startup-success
Welcome to my first repository!
----------------------------------------------
So "Main.py" is the main code. Right now, you need a python interpreter to actually use this. But hopefully in the future,
front end developers will help us out and add graphics and a nice UI for this. So, looking for front end developers.

For the time being, you need to save Main.py locally and execute it through a python interpreter.
Looking for developers fluent in python. I am using a library called "pysimplegui" to make the GUI.

Python is the language that will be used for back end as well as front end programming. Also, there will be a few webpages for support and other stuff.
