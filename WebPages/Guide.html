        This page contains a basic guide for you if you plan on establishing a startup. Note that this is not related to
        SSP, but is a general guide.

        <h1><u>Key factors of any start-up</u></h1>
        <p>
            There are some factors that play a major role in deciding the success of your startup. They are:
            <ol>
            <li>Capital</li>
            <li>Labor</li>
            <li>Uniqueness/Idea</li>
            <li>Location</li>
            <li>Demand</li>
            </ol>
            Other than these, there are other minor factors too, like the type of business, knowledge, e.t.c.
        </p>
        <hr style="border-color:rgb(6, 4, 151);">

        <p>
            <ul><li><h2><u>Capital</u></h2></li></ul>
            Different kinds of business have different amounts of recommended starting capital. For example, for a service start-up,
            one will need a minimum of 80,000 USD while the recommended is above 100,000 USD. And within services, there are other things
            like if your service is online, it will have a different amount.<br><br>
            For a trading business, a minimum of 30,000 USD is required to make substantial profits. This will also vary based on the value
            and amount of the stock you wish to purchase.<br><br>
            For starting a restaurant, a minimum of 180,000 USD is required to establish and maintain the restaurant. This has the highest capital
            requirements, but also has the highest profitability. The reason for such a high cost is due to the need to purchase a license, hire chefs,
            and to maintain the place.<br><br>
            For more accurate estimates, it is highly recommended to seek the assistance of a consultant who has good experience in the business field.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <ul><li><h2><u>Labor</u></h2></li></ul>
            Under labor there are 2 other factors, namely, skill and quantity. Skill refers to the educational and other qualifications required to do 
            the job efficiently. Quantity is the amount of labor required to complete a work in a desired amount of time.<br><br>
            Services like transportation, construction, e.t.c will require labor from mixed skills, while services that are completely dependent on the
            internet require skilled labor to maintain servers, for websites, e.t.c <br><br>
            Trading will require almosst no labor, except for an advisor or a counselor as it is entirely dependent on your skill.<br><br>
            Restaurants will require mainly unskilled labor as a waiter, server, e.t.c. But will require skilled labor for accounting and business analysis.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <ul><li><h2><u>Idea</u></h2></li></ul>
            A unique idea is almost necessary if you plan on establishing a service, or a restaurant as there will be a lot of competition in those fields and 
            a unique idea will help your business stand out.<br><br>
            But an idea is not needed for trading, only skill and knowledge is a necessity.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <ul><li><h2><u>Location</u></h2></li></ul>
            Location is another important factor for a startup.<br>
            For services that are physical rather than being an online service, a ideal location for starting would be one, where there is less competition and
            easier access to necessary resources.<br><br>
            For restaurants, an ideal location should have high demand for new restaurants. But in these places to actually succeed, a good idea is needed as stated
            before.<br><br>
            Location doesn't matter for trading unless you wish to buy stocks. While you can buy stocks from an online broker, it is not recommended as there will be
            additional charges along with commision and other hidden charges.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            <ul><li><h2><u>Demand</u></h2></li></ul>
            It is amost pointless in establishing your business in a place that has no demands/requirements for your service.<br><br>
            If a place has no demand for restaurants, it could only mean that there are too many restaurants in that area already.
            So either pick another place or have a strong and unique idea.<br><br>
            If you are trading stocks, you should always keep an eye on the demand for the stocks you have/wish to purchase. Buy them
            when the demand drops, and sell them in a high price when there is a high demand.
        </p>
        <hr style="border-color: rgb(6, 4, 151);">
