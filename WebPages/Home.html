        <p>
        Welcome to SSP Official! This is the home page for SSP Official. You can find some general information here about SSP and information about other pages.<br>
        P.S. SSP stands for Startup Success Predictor.
        </p>
            <h1><font color="red"><u>Why was this created?</u></font></h1>
        <p>
            Many people have under-estimated the difficulty of starting a business and have spent tons of hard earned money on starting a business. But without proper information 
            and knowledge, almost everyone will end in debt, without making profit. This program will hopefully guide you in the right path and decide on whether business is the 
            right choice for you. Now, obviously this isn't the only thing you need for a successful start-up. You will need an expert in the field you wish to start a business. 
            Also in this page, I have given the link to the page that contains the list of the websites from which I got my information and values from. 
        </p>
