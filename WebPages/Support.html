        <br>In this page, you will learn how to use SSP to your advantage and what to do if you encounter bugs.
        <h1><font color="red"><u>How to use SSP?</u></font></h1>
        <p>This program will hopefully guide you in the right path and decide on whether business is the right think for you.
        Now, obviously this isn't the only thing you need for a successful start-up. You will need an expert in the field you wish to start a business.
        Right now in the pre-alpha version, the GUI hasn't been added yet. So you need a python interpreter to use the code. Make sure to read the README file for detailed instructions and help.
        </p>
        <h1><font color="red"><u>How to deal with bugs?</u></font></h1>
        <p>In the pre-alpha version, it is highly unlikely to find a bug. But by chance if you encounter one, <a href="mailto:memegamer138@hotmail.com?subject=Bug Report">mail it here.</a>
           In the body section of the mail, briefly describe the bug and when you encountered it. 
        </p>
